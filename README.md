# ScientificPython

A collection of solutions to selected exercise from the book [python for everybody](https://www.py4e.com/)

The assignement folder contains the code of the projects needed to get the certification for Scientific Computation in Python from [freeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.org).

The description of the projects are inside the corresponding jupyter notebooks.

My certification is available at this [link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fabrez/scientific-computing-with-python-v7)


# Bonus

The file ``count_frequency_of_letters_in_text.ipynb`` contains a code that counts the frequency of letters in different languagues using the [MASS dataset](https://github.com/getalp/mass-dataset). This notebook expands on the Exercise 3 of Chapter 10.
